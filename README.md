## ✅ Key Task Requirements

- Combine the personality and asset datasets
- Identify the person with the **highest total asset value in GBP**
- Extract their **Risk Tolerance score** and include it in the cover letter
- Conduct EDA to explore patterns between financial traits and personality dimensions

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- The individual with the highest total assets in GBP has a **Risk Tolerance score of 0.555**
- Higher impulsivity is positively correlated with higher asset value
- Confidence and risk tolerance are strongly correlated personality traits
- Currency standardisation was essential due to large variation in values (e.g. JPY vs GBP)

For detailed plots and deeper analysis, please refer to the `insights_report.docx` and visualisation graphs.
